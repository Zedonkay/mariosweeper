# MarioSweeper

Run `main.py` to start the game.

## Project Overview

MarioSweeper is a game inspired by Minesweeper. The core logic is similar:  
- The board is a grid with hidden "flowers" (mines).
- Clicking a square reveals empty spaces or numbers, indicating how many flowers are adjacent.
- Safe squares may uncover more spaces.
- Mario follows the player's mouse within the cleared area.
- Right-clicking places a turtle shell (flag).
- If a flower is clicked, Mario is "eaten" by the flower.

## Requirements

- Install the `cpu-graphics` library.
- The "Super Mario 256" font must be installed (included as a `.ttf` file).

## Shortcut Commands

- `m` — Move
- `r` — Reset the game
